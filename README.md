# Student_Attendence_system_WebApp
This is a project for student attendence system which takes a live uploading of an image from the teacher and then scans the faces and marks the attendence of those students who are present in the class.
The main.py file is the executable file from where we can run the program.
After the program is open in Pycharm with all the necessory files we need Xamp for back-end connection.
We execute the main.py and then on the /Home page we can see our Home page from where we will upload our image of students.
This image will be processed and a face recognition and detection process will start iterating.
After getting the detection done the web page will show the output image with all the names printed on the face with a table generated. 
This table will contain all the studens present in that class.
